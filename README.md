# yHealth: 
yHealth is a hospital management software initiative, web or intranet based and open source. I'm trying to make something out of aspnetboilerplate template, which I have seen to be good and well  structured. Contributors are welcome. Experienced programmers can give me good ideas and I will gladly accept them.
